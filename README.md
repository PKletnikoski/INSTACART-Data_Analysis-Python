# INSTACART-Data_Analysis-Python
A data analysis project using PYTHON to analyze data from an online Grocery Basket, Instacart.
## OBJECTIVES
To perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Analyze the data to answer questions from marketing and sales teams (for example, busiest time of day,highest grossing days of the week, most loyal customers, etc.).

Analyze the data to discover differences in user's ordering habits based various characteristics (such as region, income, loyalty status, etc.).

Create customer profiles based on combinations of variables and analyze how their ordering behaviors may differ (for instance: pet owners, vegetarian/vegan, etc.).

## TOOLS
**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy

**Software:** Jupyter Notebooks and Excel

## NEEDED SKILLS
**Data Consistency Checks and Data Wrangling**:removing duplicates, found and resolving missing values, addressing mixed or incorrect data types.

**Combining & Exporting Data**: selecting and preparing data for merging, and exporting final merge as a pkl file.

**Derived new variables:** grouping data by user, order, and department to allow exploration and analysis at each level; using aggregated data to create flags about user ordering habits (such as ‘new customer’, ‘loyal customer’, etc.) and demographic info (such as ‘with babies’ or ‘pet owner’); confirming the new data created via crosstabs and value counts.

**Exploratory analysis:** exploring basic descriptive statistics (max/min, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable as well as using histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts to explore the distributions of data.

**Visualizing data:** using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked).

**Reporting results:** providing an Excel file that explained the answers to questions from sales/marketing as well as documenting the data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling, and column derivations.
